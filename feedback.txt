Notes:

Great job!

Looks like the data is being rendered multiple times by mistake. This can be fixed by moving the closing curly brace } of the "for loop" to just after the closing brace of the "if statement". 

Could recommend using data-id or some "data attribute" for storing information on your <li> tags. This would be a safer practice for dealing with data in general, rather than relying on the innerHTML to find the right person.
